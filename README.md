# R55-is-NOT-43
The 100-year-old math problem the Ramsey Number: R(5,5) â‰  43. 

# 1. What is Ramsey Number?

Ramsey number is math problem that finding the minimum number of vertices k = R(m,n) so that any undirected graph with k vertices always contains a clique of m or an independent set of m.

# 2. What is latest updates on R(5,5)?

R(5,5) is the next Ramsey number with m=n that is not totally solved yet. Here are the latest updates:

* In 1989, [Geoffrey Exoo](http://isu.indstate.edu/ge/) found the lower bound of R(5,5)>=43 at 1989. 
* In 2019, Vigleik Angeltveit and Brendan D. Mckay found the upper bound of R(5,5)<=48 at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08768.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08768.pdf). 
* The latest update about upper bound of Ramsy number is from [Ashwin Sah](http://www.mit.edu/~asah/) at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09251.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09251.pdf). 

# 3. What's the target of this project?
